I apologize for the confusion. It seems that `xvfb` is not available as a standalone package on macOS. Instead, you can use Xvfb as part of the X11 windowing system that is included with XQuartz.

Here are the steps to use Xvfb with XQuartz on macOS:

1. Install XQuartz from the official website: https://www.xquartz.org/

2. Open XQuartz and go to the XQuartz menu -> Preferences.

3. In the Preferences window, go to the "Security" tab and ensure that the "Allow connections from network clients" checkbox is selected.

4. Close the Preferences window and open a new terminal window.

5. In the terminal window, run the following command to start Xvfb:

```shell
Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1400x900x24 &
```

6. Set the `DISPLAY` environment variable to `:1`:

```shell
export DISPLAY=:1
```

7. Run your `train.py` script as before, but without `xvfb-run`:

```shell
python train.py
```

This should start the virtual framebuffer and allow you to run the `train.py` script with the game screen rendered without an actual physical display.
